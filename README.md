# MusicJunkies-Frontend

MusicJunkies is a responsive music review/ recommendation web application similar to letterboxd which is for movies. Our application allows users to review and keep track of their favorite music albums.
It is a portal for music lovers to review and recommend music. 
This repository implements the frontend part of the portal using React. 
This project is done as part of Software Production Engineering Course.
